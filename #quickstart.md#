# Raspberry Pi Quick Start Guide

Got a Raspberry Pi? Great: let's get started by making sure you have all the cables and accessories before plugging them all in.

## Check you have the equipment you need

Before you plug anything into your Raspberry Pi, make sure that you have all the equipment you need:
- A monitor with the correct cable and adaptor.
- A micro-USB Power Supply
- A wired keyboard and mouse, or a wireless keyboard and mouse with a bluetooth adaptor
- A micro SD card
- A Raspberry Pi

To get started with Raspberry Pi, you also need an operating system. If you haven't purchased a preinstalled SD card, then details on how to install an operating to an SD card, follow the [software setup guide](). 

## Monitors

There are several different types of monitor that you can use with the Raspberry Pi:

### HDMI
Most modern television sets and monitors have an HDMI port, and are the easiest to get working with the Raspberry Pi. You can use an HDMI cable to connect the Raspberry Pi directly to the television or monitor.

### DVI
Some older monitors have a DVI port. These work well with the Raspberry Pi, although you will need an HDMI to DVI adaptor to attach to an HDMI cable, or a one-piece HDMI to DVI cable.

### VGA
Some old monitors have a VGA port. These can be trickier to use as you need an HDMI to VGA convertor, that can change a digital video to analogue video. A simple port adaptor will not work.

## Power Supplies

There are several options for powering your Raspberry Pi.



## Plugging in your Raspberry Pi

1. Begin by slotting your SD card into the SD card slot on the Raspberry Pi. It will only fit one way.
1. Next, plug in your USB keyboard and mouse into the USB ports on the Raspberry Pi.
1. Make sure that your monitor or TV is turned on, and that you have selected the right input (e.g. HDMI 1, DVI, etc).
1. Connect your HDMI cable from your Raspberry Pi to your monitor or TV.
1. If you intend to connect your Raspberry Pi to the internet, plug an Ethernet cable into the Ethernet port, or connect a WiFi dongle to one of the USB ports. 
1. When you are happy that you have plugged all the cables and SD card in correctly, connect the micro USB power supply. This action will turn on and boot your Raspberry Pi.

1. If this is the first time your Raspberry Pi and SD card have been used, then you will have to select an operating system and configure it.

# Adding audio output

## 3.5mm audio port

The Raspberry Pi comes equipped with a 3.5mm audio port. This will allow you to plug most speakers or headphones into the Raspberry Pi, so that you can listen to the output from fantastic programs like [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/).

## Bluetooth speakers

With either the Raspberry Pi 3 or a Bluetooth dongle, you can connect to Bluetooth speakers or headphones. Your success rates may vary depending on the dongle and/or speakers you're using, so ensure that you read the manufacturer's documentation.

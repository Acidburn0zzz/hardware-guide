# Raspberry Pi Networking

You'll probably want to connect your Raspberry Pi to your local network or the internet. You can use any of the following options to do this:

## Connecting via Ethernet

The Raspberry Pi has an Ethernet port, alongside the USB ports. If your Raspberry Pi is situated close to a router, access point, or switch, you can connect to a network using an Ethernet cable.

Once you have plugged the Ethernet cable into the Raspberry Pi and the other end into an access point, your Raspberry Pi will automatically connect to the network.

## Connecting via WiFi

If you have a Raspberry Pi 3, then there is built-in WiFi. If you are using an earlier version of the Raspberry Pi, then you will need a USB WiFi dongle.

Some WiFi dongles, when used with the Raspberry Pi, are simple [plug and play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug_and_play) devices. Others require specific drivers, and may not be compatible with the Raspberry Pi. Make sure you read the device manufacturer's documentation before making a purchase.

You can buy the official Raspberry Pi WiFi dongle from [The Pi Hut](https://thepihut.com/collections/raspberry-pi-wifi/products/official-raspberry-pi-wifi-adapter) or [Farnell](http://cpc.farnell.com/element14/wipi/dongle-wifi-usb-for-raspberry/dp/SC12761).
